We're finishing up our UI and backend for the presentations next week. Unfortunately, we will not be running a test in a classroom before classes end. However, our pitch deck will demonstrate the minimum viable product and what it could be under better circumstances. Perhaps next semester we can run a full trial. Thank you to our TAs for their continued support.
