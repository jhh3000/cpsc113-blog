This week, we’ve started thinking about what hypotheses need to be validated. There are three critical assumptions that need to be tested:

  * Students will submit feedback when they are confused.
  * Professors will put the feedback to use improving their lectures.
  * Administrators will feel the service is worth paying for.

All these problems connect to the larger issue of customer validation. Before building anything, we need to conduct many interviews with the two user groups (students and professors) and the customer group (administrators) to see if the value proposition is viable. We need to get inside the heads of each of these sets of people to unpack their values, goals, and problems. Professors are the key user base - if this product provides enough value to them, they have considerable leverage over both students and administrators to drive adoption.

The first step is to conduct interviews with representatives from all three groups. We plan to schedule 10 student interviews, 10 professor interviews, and 3 administrator interviews to begin collecting data. Do our users and customers exist, and do they have the pain we think they do? At this stage, we can also run some preliminary solution interviews that investigate what kinds of services and features work best for professors and students.

If we get enough validation for our UVP from the interviews, we will run several MVP trials in classrooms. We will sit in on a class where students will use a basic one-button interface on a heroku site that will collect data on their understanding. We might not even display the data for the professor in this trial - we are only testing the first hypothesis. If that is validated, we will run subsequent trials that integrate the professor.

If we don’t get enough validation on campus, we might pivot to a K-12 classroom setting. We plan on conducting early interviews with high school teachers and students regardless to see if our product might be a better fit for that environment.
