We've had an excellent time in CPSC113 with Kyle, April, Jason, Hannia, and David. Our scrappy team of Jeff, Trent, and Michael have had the wonderful opportunity to design and build an app that could potentially help alleviate glazed donut faces in classrooms across the world. This experience has been quite eye opening in terms of the amount of work required to launch even a basic prototype for a startup, let alone get an entire company off the ground. Nevertheless, it has brought a sense of invigoration to each team member and we will all be motivated to pursue entrepreneurial ventures in the future, whether practically or in spirit.

Our primary lessons learned include the importance of testing and proving out the concept early. Though we attempted to line up classroom demos once we knew who our target customer and demographic would be, we didn't leave enough lead time to negotiate contracts or handshake agreements to actually test in class. This resulted in us not hitting our timeline for deployment before the final class meeting, which we deeply are saddened about. However, we hope that development of this prototype will not be permanently stalled, and that one day there can be a Lectern in every classroom.

Best wishes,
The Lectern Team
